# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Oopsâ€”We forgot to include a "user_id" attribute when we created the Product model. To do that now, we'll have to run the following in the terminal:

#   rails g migration add_user_id_to_products user_id:integer

# Alternate syntax: 

#   rails g migration AddUser_idToProducts user_id:integer
