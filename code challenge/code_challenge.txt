Coding Challenge: String Permutations
Imagine you've got a string like presentable and you scramble the letters to get a second string like albrnpeetse. The second string is called a permutation of the first. A permutation of a string is any string that has exactly the same characters as the original but in a different order.
Write a function in Ruby or JavaScript that receives two strings as arguments. The function should figure out whether or not those two strings are permutations of each other. It should return true if they are permutations of each other or return false if they are not permutations of each other.
permutations?("presentable", "albrnpeetse")  #=> true
permutations?("presentable", "raelsbtpene")  #=> true
permutations?("presentable", "taco")         #=> false
permutations?("taco", "cato")                #=> true
permutations?("taco", "cat")                 #=> false
